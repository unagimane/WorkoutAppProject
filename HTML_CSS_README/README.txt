I am developing this app because I ran into problems tracking my workouts,

I want to build a platform that allows users to track and graph their workouts to see progress over time.

The app will have a main page for personal stats, weight, height, run times, and other exercises and how those progress over time as well as a place to set goals.

Other features will include: a social platform for users to share their stats, workouts, and the supplements they are using which will lead into paid promotions and adspace.
